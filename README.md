# Computer_Graphics_Project_OpenGL
 Creating a visual simulation of data using OpenGL and C


This project was completed for the Computer Graphics module from the third year of the Computer Science degree at the University of Salford. The aim of this assignment was to create a simulation using openGL and the C programming language. The application aim is to produce a simple visualisation comprising of a collection of discrete objects located in a navigable space. Completion of this application involved careful consideration of the management of scene data, use of resizable dynamic memory structures, and the application of appropriate mathematical models for simulation, navigation, and interaction.

The application presents simple data visualisation of world trade data which utilises a graphical representation to present an intuitive graphical structure based on a set of data attributes.

Note: This project involved a template project which included a maths library, file parser, basic data structure, and camera model. Due to the large size of the project, only relevant created code has been included for portfolio purposes.
